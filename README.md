# swe-score
good swe? bad swe? a simple score can make that judgment for you!

**our score takes into consideration the following factors to assign your github profile a letter score:**
1. **contribution frequency** - how many commits, pull requests, and issues have you submitted over the past year?
2. **code quantity** - how many total lines of code have you contributed?
3. **code quality** - a code analysis tool assesses code quality metrics such as code duplication and complexity
4. **diversity of languages & technologies** - how many different programming languages have you used on your profile?
5. **project collaboration** - how often do you contribute to projects that haven't been created by you?
6. **project impact** - how impactful have the projects you've contributed to been to the developer community? (stars, forks, etc.)
7. **documentation and readability** - are your repositories well-documented?
8. **pull-request acceptance** - at what rate do your pull-requests get merged?
